We have an equal equity split between everyone.

## Reading order

All the report content is in the `report/` directory. The report takes the following structure:

* 01_Introduction_EDA_and_preprocessing.ipynb
* 02_BagofWords.ipynb
* 03_Word2Vec.ipynb
* 04_BERT.ipynb
* 05_RNN.ipynb
* 06_Conclusion.ipynb

There also some appendices to our report found in the `appendices/` folder.

Any requirements are found in the import statements in various notebooks. We recommend using Google Colab for running the notebooks as it already has many of the required packages installed, and can use a GPU runtime for replicating our work the used a GPU.

## Evidence

Our working is shown in our own named directories.

We all conducted initial research of medical datasets at scale and text processing techniques.
Geraint developed the preprocessing method and implemented various Bag of Words models; Abbie worked on Word2Vec approaches with a CNN classifier; Ethan worked on BERT models as well as some EDA to help inform the preprocessing; and Revati worked on RNNs and also did some research on BERTs.
